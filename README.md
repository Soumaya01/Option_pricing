# Option_pricing
This repository contains a code for option pricing using fourier methods when the underlying follows an exponential a Levy  dynamic.An important element in option pricing models is modeling stock prices with jumps. Jump (Levy) processes can describe the observed reality of financial markets in a more accurate way than basic diffusion models based onBrownian motion. This  repository contains also  a code to simulate different type of Levy processes(jump diffusion models and infinite activity  models)
